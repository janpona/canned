Preface: Identity
Replacements: [G] (group identity)
Text:
[G] people are individuals; they are people,
and every person is unique and special,
even with intersecting group identities.

If you are a [G] person or are picturing a particular [G] person,
some topics may resonate and ring true to you,
and some topics may seem very different
from what you have known and seen.
